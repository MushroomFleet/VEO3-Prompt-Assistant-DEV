## Cinematic Scene Examples

### Monastery Scene
**Prompt:** An aerial shot swoops down through misty mountain peaks toward a hidden monastery perched on a cliff edge. A lone monk in orange robes tends to a small garden of cherry blossoms. The monk looks up at approaching storm clouds and whispers, "This storm will test our resolve, but we shall remain steadfast like these ancient stones."

### Office Elevator Scene
**Prompt:** A very crowded office elevator during morning rush hour. The doors are closed at the start of the video, and as they begin to slowly open, we hear soft elevator music from the ceiling speakers and a gentle mechanical hum. The camera holds a single, continuous, eye-level shot, focused tightly on two well-dressed colleagues standing face-to-face — uncomfortably close due to the packed space. Just as the elevator doors are halfway open, the man calmly and confidently says: "I once sneezed in the all-hands and clicked 'share screen' at the same time. No survivors." The woman reacts with genuine laughter — amused but never exaggerated — and she never speaks, recoils, touches her face, or steps back. Around them, the other elevator passengers remain relaxed and detached: one scrolls on their phone, another stares forward in thought, someone else shifts their bag — but no one looks at or reacts to the main characters. The doors continue to open fully, and at the end of the shot, the two colleagues step out of the elevator while the camera stays fixed in place. The characters never look into the camera. Do not include any captions, subtitles, or on-screen text.

### Woman with Alligator (Complete Planning Example)
**Prompt:** A cinematic scene set at night: a glamorous woman with an afro hairstyle and gold jewellery shares a luxurious outdoor pool with a calm alligator. The pool area is surrounded by classical statues and large blue ceramic vases, all dimly lit. The camera starts at water level and slowly zooms in on the woman's face as she makes intense eye contact with the camera. The lighting is moody and soft, with candlelight reflections on the water and a subtle fill light on her face. The audio features slow ambient electronic music, with occasional water ripple sounds. The color palette includes deep slate gray, ocean blue, and warm gold tones. The woman says, "I'm not afraid of anything… except Sundays without drama." No subtitles.

### Snow Leopard - Enhanced
**Prompt:** Create a short 3D animated scene in a joyful cartoon style. A cute creature with snow leopard-like fur, large expressive eyes, and a friendly, rounded form happily prances through a whimsical winter forest. The scene should feature rounded, snow-covered trees, gentle falling snowflakes, and warm sunlight filtering through the branches. The creature's bouncy movements and wide smile should convey pure delight. Aim for an upbeat, heartwarming tone with bright, cheerful colors and playful animation. Consider adding subtle, whimsical sound effects to enhance the joyful winter atmosphere.

## Progressive Refinement Examples

### Man on Phone - Version 1 (Basic)
**Prompt:** The camera dollies to show a close up of a desperate man in a green trench coat that's making a call on a rotary-style wall phone with a green neon light and a movie scene.

### Man on Phone - Version 2 (Detailed)
**Prompt:** A close-up cinematic shot follows a desperate man in a weathered green trench coat as he dials a rotary phone mounted on a gritty brick wall, bathed in the eerie glow of a green neon sign. The camera dollies in, revealing the tension in his jaw and the desperation etched on his face as he struggles to make the call. The shallow depth of field focuses on his furrowed brow and the black rotary phone, blurring the background into a sea of neon colors and indistinct shadows, creating a sense of urgency and isolation.

### Man on Phone - Version 3 (Highly Detailed)
**Prompt:** A video with smooth motion that dollies in on a desperate man in a green trench coat, using a vintage rotary phone against a wall bathed in an eerie green neon glow. The camera starts from a medium distance, slowly moving closer to the man's face, revealing his frantic expression and the sweat on his brow as he urgently dials the phone. The focus is on the man's hands, his fingers fumbling with the dial as he desperately tries to connect. The green neon light casts long shadows on the wall, adding to the tense atmosphere. The scene is framed to emphasize the isolation and desperation of the man, highlighting the stark contrast between the vibrant glow of the neon and the man's grim determination.

## Creative & Complex Scenarios

### LEGO World Adventure
**Prompt:** A dynamic camera glides through a miniature LEGO world, where an epic adventure unfolds. All sound effects—footsteps, explosions, cars, dragons—are created using mouth sounds by a single AI-generated voice artist. As each sound is made, the visuals instantly respond: LEGO characters jump into action, cars race, spaceships take off, volcanoes erupt. The journey moves through LEGO-built environments—city streets, underwater ruins, space stations, and lava lairs. The video is fast-paced, playful, and visually rich, like a blend between The LEGO Movie and next-gen AI storytelling. The sound-to-visual sync creates a magical, toy-driven universe where imagination controls reality.

### Rap Battle: Newton vs Einstein
**Prompt:** A high-energy rap battle between Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein on a futuristic sci-fi stage. The camera alternates between close-ups and dramatic wide shots as they diss each other with sharp lyrics. Newton, in a classic 17th-century outfit, raps with a British accent about gravity and apples. Einstein, with wild hair and a German accent, fires back about relativity and space-time. Their lip-sync is perfectly timed to the beat, and their facial expressions are intense and animated. The background pulses with neon lights and holographic equations, reacting to the rhythm. The crowd of AI-generated scientists cheers them on in sync with the music. It feels like a rap battle from another dimension.

### Dinosaur Musician
**Prompt:** A dinosaur with a white fedora and a Hawaiian shirt playing an acoustic guitar on stage at a small waterside bar in Puerto Rico. The dinosaur is singing about how things used to be in the Mesozoic Era. People are clapping and laughing. The video is fast-paced, playful, and visually rich, like a blend between The LEGO Movie and next-gen AI storytelling. The sound-to-visual sync creates a magical, toy-driven universe where imagination controls reality.

### Koala Dance Battle
**Prompt:** A humanoid koala in stylish streetwear steps into a neon-lit urban dance stage to battle another breakdancing koala. As the hip-hop track kicks in, the two koalas start a wild dance-off—spinning, locking, popping, and head-spinning in sync with the beat. The music directly drives their movement, with every bass hit triggering exaggerated, stylized animation. During beat drops, the camera cuts to slow-motion close-ups: fur sways mid-spin, claws strike poses, eyes focused with intensity. The environment is full of urban flavor: graffiti walls, flashing lights, and a crowd of other animals cheering wildly. It's hilarious, dynamic, and full of dance battle energy—like Step Up, but with koalas.

### Pixar-Style Dialogue
**Prompt:** A Pixar style animation with two characters. A male chunk of dirt creature standing with a female fireball creature. The male dirt guy says "wow! You're hot today!" The female says back "then why do you treat me like dirt?"
