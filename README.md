## üí° Example Transformation

**Input:** "A person walking on a beach"

**AI-Enhanced Output:**
```
A cinematic wide shot of a young woman in flowing white linen clothing walking barefoot along a pristine sandy beach at golden hour. The camera performs a slow dolly shot, paralleling her movement as gentle waves lap at the shore. Warm sunset tones of amber and coral illuminate the scene, with soft natural lighting creating a peaceful, contemplative mood. The audio features gentle ocean waves, distant seabird calls, and a subtle ambient instrumental score. Her long hair moves softly in the ocean breeze as she gazes thoughtfully toward the horizon. The color palette emphasizes warm golden and coral sunset tones with cool blue ocean accents. No dialogue, no subtitles.
```
